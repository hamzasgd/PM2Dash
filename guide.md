# PM2 Manager GUI Suggestions

Building a comprehensive PM2 manager GUI is a great idea! PM2 is a powerful process manager for Node.js applications, but its command-line interface can be challenging for some users. Here are suggestions to make your PM2 GUI effective and user-friendly:

## Core Features

### 1. Process Management
- **Process list view** with sorting and filtering options
- **Real-time status updates** for all processes
- **Basic controls**: start, stop, restart, reload, delete
- **Bulk actions** to manage multiple processes at once

### 2. Monitoring and Metrics
- **Resource usage graphs** (CPU, memory, event loop latency)
- **Historical data** for performance analysis
- **Custom alerts/notifications** for resource thresholds
- **Log viewer** with search and filtering capabilities

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Visual ecosystem file editor** for easier configuration
- **Application deployment** interface
- **Environment variable management**
- **Cluster mode visualization and configuration**

## Advanced Features

### 4. Dashboard and Analytics
- **Customizable dashboard** with widgets
- **System-wide metrics** (server health, network stats)
- **Uptime tracking** and availability statistics

### 5. Remote Management
- **Multi-server support** to manage PM2 across different hosts
- **Access control** with user roles and permissions
- **API integration** for external tools

### 6. Deployment Features
- **One-click deployment** from Git repositories
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed deployments
- **Deployment history** and comparison

### 7. Integration Options
- **Webhooks** for other services
- **Logging integration** with tools like ELK, Datadog, etc.
- **Authentication** with LDAP, OAuth, etc.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Consider a client-server architecture where the server communicates with PM2's API
- Use websockets for real-time updates
- Consider Electron for desktop app or modern web frameworks for browser-based interface

### User Experience
- Create an intuitive, clean interface with good information hierarchy
- Include dark/light mode
- Support keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Make the dashboard responsive for different screen sizes

### Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Unique Features to Consider

- **Intelligent restart suggestions** based on performance metrics
- **Automated scaling** based on load patterns
- **Natural language commands** for common operations
- **Health score** for each application based on multiple factors
- **Dependency graph visualization** between services
- **Template library** for common application configurations

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific area of this PM2 manager GUI concept?
